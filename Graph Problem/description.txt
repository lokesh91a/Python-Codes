Description:
This problem is a graph problem.

test1:
1.Contains mixture of floating and integer type of x and y coordinates and radius: Runs successfully
2.Run the file with wrong file name: Executes successfully and displayes appropriate message
3.Run this file with no data
4.Run this file with only 1 cow or 1 paintball on it: Runs successfully

test2:
Checks the condition that if more than 1 paintball on triggering paints same no. of maximum colors on cows then only 1 of these should be 
printed.
All 3 paintballs orange, red and blue paints the cow notice2 with 3 colors but in the end only orange paintball is printed as a answer
 
test3:
1.Checks if no paintball paints any cows present then message should be displayed that no cows are painted by any starting paintball
2.Also checks that if paintball1 triggers paintball2 and paintball2 triggers paintball1 then code should not throw error "maximum recursion
 depth reached". In the given example all colors triggers all other colors but code runs successfully

test4:
Checks the 3rd condition i.e if on triggering 1 paintball paints only 1 cow but with 3 colors and on triggering other paintball 2 cows are painted but each with only 1 color then final result should be the paintball which was triggered first
in this paintball(forUNIQUECOWS) paints 2 cows unique1 and unique2 but on triggering any other paintball, cow(notice) is painted by 3 colors: PURPLE, ORANGE and GREEN and output should be this
